== Elasticsearch Migration Helper

This plugin will help you to check whether you can upgrade directly to the
next major version of Elasticsearch, or whether you need to make changes to
your data and cluster before doing so.

It is available in two versions:

* https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration/tree/2.x[For upgrading from Elasticsearch 2.x to Elasticsearch 5.x]
* https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration/tree/1.x[For upgrading from Elasticsearch 1.x to Elasticsearch 2.x]
